# bitesTask

To run this backend application you need to run "docker compose up" on root project directory.
This should start all of the needed components for back-end.
You can open swagger ui documentation via this link ::::
      http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

Then you can see the end-points provided for the back-end application.
Some logs are sent to Kafka topics, dependent on the class.
